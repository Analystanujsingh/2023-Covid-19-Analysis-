# COVID-19 Statewise Data Visualization Dashboard

## Description

This project is a COVID-19 State Data Visualization Dashboard built using Python, Plotly, and Dash. The dashboard provides visual insights into COVID-19 statistics across different states/UTs in India. It offers various visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, word clouds, and network graphs to help users understand the pandemic's impact.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Plotly
- Dash
- Pandas

## Data Set

The dataset used in this project contains COVID-19 statistics for various states/UTs in India. It includes information on total cases, active cases, deaths, recoveries, and population data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Process

1. Data Loading: Loaded the COVID-19 dataset.
2. Data Cleaning: Removed missing values, handled outliers if any.
3. Data Overview: Checked basic statistics, distributions, and correlations among variables.
4. Feature Engineering: Calculated additional metrics like case fatality rate.
5. Visualizations: Created initial visualizations to understand data patterns.

## Data Visualization

1. Bar Charts: Displayed total cases, deaths, recoveries by state.
2. Pie Charts: Represented the distribution of cases by type (active, recovered, deaths) over the population.
3. Network Graph: Visualized connections between states/UTs based on COVID-19 statistics.

## Insights and Findings

- Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Kerala reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases.
- Active cases were significantly high in certain states despite total cases being lower, suggesting ongoing outbreaks.
- Case Fatality Rate (CFR) varied across states, indicating different healthcare system capacities.
